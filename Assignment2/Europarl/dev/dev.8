Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;

This Directive shall apply to aerosol dispensers as defined in Article 2, with the exception of those with a maximum capacity of less than 50 ml, and those with a maximum capacity greater than that specified in points 3.1, 4.1.1, 4.2.1, 5.1 and 5.2 respectively of the Annex to this Directive.

Whereas the aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty ; whereas, in the poultrymeat sector, in order to stabilize markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural Community concerned, provision should be made for measures to facilitate the adjustment of supply to market requirements;
Whereas it is necessary to avoid disturbances on the Community market caused by offers made on the world market at abnormally low prices ; whereas to this end sluice-gate prices should be fixed and levies should be increased by an additional amount when free-at-frontier offer prices are lower than those prices;
Whereas the establishment of a single market would be jeopardized by the granting of certain aids ; whereas, therefore, the provisions of the Treaty which allow the assessment of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of those which are incompatible with the common market should be made to apply to poultrymeat;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
(c) "slaughtered poultry" means dead fowls, ducks, geese, turkeys and guinea fowls, whole, with or without offal;
3. edible offals specified in paragraph 1 (b),

2. The sluice-gate price for slaughtered poultry shall be composed of: (a) an amount equal to the price on the world market for the quantity of feed grain, varied according to kind of poultry, which is required for the production in third countries of one kilogramme of slaughtered poultry;
However, when the sluice-gate price applicable from 1 November, 1 February and 1 May is being fixed, trends in world market prices for feed grain shall be taken into account only if the price of the quantity of feed grain shows a minimum variation from that used in calculating the sluice-gate price for the preceding quarter. The information used in fixing the standard amount mentioned in (b) shall be reconsidered at least once a year.
5. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt rules for the application of this Article.
