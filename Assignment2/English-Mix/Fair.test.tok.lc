all right , i 'll go . i 'll go .
sorry .
ohh !
look where you 're goin ' , dear . look where you 're goin ' .
i 'm so sorry .
two bunches of violets trod in the mud . a full day 's wages .
freddy . freddy , go and find a cab !
yes , mother .
oh , he 's your son , is he ?
well , if you 'd done your duty by him as a mother should , you wouldn 't let him spoil a poor girl 's flowers and then run away without payin ' .
oh , go about your business , my girl .
and you wouldn 't go off without payin ' either .
two bunches of violets trod in the mud .
jove ! good heavens !
oh , sir , is there any sign of it stopping ?
i 'm afraid not . it 's worse than before .
oh , dear !
if it 's worse , it 's a sign it 's nearly over .
cheer up , captain . buy a flower off a poor girl ?
i 'm sorry . i haven 't any change .
oh , i can change half a crown .
here , take this for tuppence .
i told you , i 'm awfully sorry . i haven 't-- oh , wait a minute .
oh , yes . here 's three ha 'pence , if that 's any use to you .
thank you , sir .
hey , you , be careful . better give him a flower for it .
there 's a bloke here behind that pillar , taking down every blessed word you 're saying .
i ain 't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman .
i 've a right to sell flowers if i keep off of the curb .
i 'm a respectable girl , so help me .
i never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me !
oh , don 't start !
what 's all the bloomin ' noise ?
there 's a " tec " takin ' her down .
well , i 'm making an honest living !
who 's doing all that shouting ?
where 's it coming from ?
oh , sir , don 't let him charge me ! you don 't know what it means to me !
they 'll-- they 'll take away me character and drive me on the streets ! for-- for speaking to gentlemen !
there , there , there , there . who 's hurting you , you silly girl ? what do you take me for ?
on my bible oath , i never spoke a word .
oh , shut up , shut up .
do i look like a policeman ?
then what 'd you take down me words for ?
how do i know you took me down right ? you just show me what you wrote about me .
oh .
what 's that ? that ain 't proper writing . i can 't read it .
i can .
" i say , captain , now buy you a flower off a poor girl . "
oh , it 's ' cause i called him " captain . "
i meant no harm . oh , sir , don 't let him lay a charge against me for a word like that !
charge ?
i 'll make no charge .
you don 't know what--
really , sir , if you are a detective , you needn 't begin protecting me ... against molestation from young women until i ask you .
anyone can tell the girl meant no harm .
he ain 't no " tec . " he 's a gentleman . look at his boots .
how are all your people down at selsey ?
who told you my people come from selsey ?
never mind . they do .
how do you come to be up so far east ? you were born in lisson grove .
ohh , what harm is there in my leaving lisson grove ?
it weren 't fit for a pig to live in and i had to pay four and six a week .
oh , live where you like , but stop that noise .
come , come , he can 't touch you .
you have a right to live where you please .
i 'm a good girl , i am !
yes , dear . yes .
where do i come from ?
hoxton .
well , who said i didn 't ? blimey , you know everything , you do .
you , sir . do you think you could find me a taxi ?
i don 't know whether you 've noticed it , madam , but it 's stopped raining . you can get a motor bus to , uh , hampton court .
well , that 's where you live , isn 't it ?
what impertinence !
hey , uh , tell him where he comes from , you want to go fortune telling .
cheltenham , harrow ,
cambridge and , uh , india ?
quite right !
blimey , he ain 't a " tec . " he 's a bloomin ' busybody .
that 's what he is .
if i may ask , sir , do you do this sort of thing for a living at a music hall ?
well , i have thought of it . perhaps i will one day .
he 's no gentleman . he ain 't , to interfere with a poor girl !
how do you do it , may i ask ?
simple phonetics .
the science of speech . that 's my profession . also my hobby .
anyone can spot an irishman or a yorkshireman by his brogue , but i can place a man within six miles .
i can place him within two miles in london . sometimes within two streets .
he ought to be ashamed of himself , unmanly coward !
is there a living in that ?
oh , yes . quite a fat one .
let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl--
woman !
cease this detestable " boo-hooing " instantly ... or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship .
i 've a right to be here if i like , same as you .
a woman who utters such disgusting and depressing noise , she has no right to be anywhere , no right to live .
remember that you 're a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech , that your native language is the language of shakespeare and milton and the bible .
don 't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon .
ohh !
look at her a prisoner of the gutters
condemned by every syllable she utters
by right , she should be taken out and hung
for the cold-blooded murder of the english tongue
ohh !
" ohh ! "
heavens , what a sound this is what the british population
calls an elementary education
come , sir , i think you picked a poor example .
did i ?
hear them down in soho square dropping " h " s everywhere
speaking english any way they like
uh , you , sir , did you go to school
what do you " tike " me for a fool
no one taught him " take " instead of " tike "
hear a yorkshireman , or worse hear a cornishman converse
i 'd rather hear a choir singing flat
chickens cackling in a barn
just like this one
garn !
" garn " ! i ask you , sir , what sort of word is that ?
it 's " ohh " and " garn " that keep her in her place
not her wretched clothes and dirty face
why can 't the english teach their children how to speak
this verbal class distinction by now should be antique
if you spoke as she does , sir instead of the way you do
why , you might be selling flowers too
i beg your pardon ?
an englishman 's way of speaking absolutely classifies him
the moment he talks he makes some other englishman despise him
one common language i 'm afraid we 'll never get
oh , why can 't the english learn to
set a good example to people whose english
is painful to your ears
the scotch and the irish leave you close to tears
there even are places where english completely disappears
well , in america , they haven 't used it for years
why can 't the english teach their children how to speak
norwegians learn norwegian the greeks are taught their greek
in france , every frenchman knows his language from " a " to " zed "
the french don 't care what they do , actually , as long as they pronounce it properly .
arabians learn arabian with the speed of summer lightning
the hebrews learn it backwards which is absolutely frightening
use proper english you 're regarded as a freak
oh , why can 't the english
why can 't the english learn
to speak
thank you .
you see this creature with her curbstone english , the english that 'll keep her in the gutter ' til the end of her days ?
well , sir , in six months , i could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball .
i could even get her a job as a lady 's maid or a shop assistant ... which requires better english .
here , what 's that you say ?
yes , you squashed cabbage leaf ; you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns ; you incarnate insult to the english language .
i could pass you off as , uh , the queen of sheba .
ohh ! you don 't believe that , captain ?
anything 's possible .
i , myself , am a student of indian dialects .
are you ? do you know colonel pickering , the author ofspoken sanskrit ?
i am colonel pickering . who are you ?
i 'm henry higgins , author of higgins ' universal alphabet .
i came from india to meet you .
i was going to india to meet you !
higgins !
pickering !
higgins !
where are you staying ?
at the carlton .
no , you 're not . you 're staying at 27-a wimpole street .
you come along with me . we 'll have a little jaw over supper .
right , you are .
indian dialects have always fascinated me .
buy a flower , kind sir ?
i 'm short for me lodging .
liar .
you said you could change half a crown .
you ought to be stuffed with nails , you ought !
here , take the whole bloomin ' basket for sixpence !
a reminder .
how many are there , actually ?
how many what ?
eh , indian dialects .
no fewer than 147 distinct languages are recorded as vernacular .
ohh .
ohh !
ohh .
shouldn 't we stand up , gentlemen ?
we 've got a bloomin ' heiress in our midst .

it 's nearly 5 : 00 . my daughter eliza 'll be along soon .
she ought to be good for a half crown for her father what loves her .
loves her ? that 's a laugh . you ain 't been near her for months .
what 's that got to do with it ? what 's half a crown after all i 've give her ?
when did you ever give her anything ?
anything ? i give her everything .
i give her the greatest gift any human being can give to another : life .
i introduced her to this here planet , i did , with all its wonders and marvels .
the sun that shines , the moon that glows .
hyde park to walk through on a fine spring night .
the whole ruddy city of london to roam around in , sellin ' her bloomin ' flowers .
i give her all that , then i disappears and leaves her on her own to enjoy it .
now , if that ain 't worth half a crown now and again , i 'll take my belt off and give her what for .
you 've got a good heart , alfie , but you want a half a crown out of eliza , you better have a good story to go with it .
leave that to me , my boy .
good morning , george .

good morning , dear algernon .

i ain 't gonna take me hard-earned wages and let you pass ' em on to a bloody pub keeper !
cruel .
eliza , you wouldn 't have the heart to send me home to your stepmother ... without a drop of liquid protection , now , would ya ?
stepmother , indeed .
well , i 'm willing to marry her . it 's me that suffers by it .
i 'm a slave to that woman , eliza . just because i ain 't her lawful husband .
ah , come on . slip your old dad just half a crown to go home on .
well , i had a bit of luck meself last night .

so , here .
but don 't keep comin ' around countin ' on half crowns from me .
thank you , eliza . you 're a noble daughter .
beer , beer glorious beer
fill yourself right up to here
but she 's been ill .
yeah , i know .
you see this creature with her curbstone english , the english that 'll keep her in the gutter ' til the end of her days ?
in six months , i could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball .
i could even get her a job as a lady 's maid or a shop assistant which requires better english .
you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns !
i could even get her a job as a lady 's maid or a shop assistant which requires better english .
now , how many vowel sounds do you think you 've heard altogether ?
i believe i counted 24 .
wrong by a hundred .
what ?
to be exact , you heard 130 .
now listen to them one at a time .
must i ?
i 'm really quite done up for one morning .
your name , please .
your name , miss .
my name is of no concern to you whatsoever .
one moment , please .
oh , london is getting so dirty these days .
i 'm mrs. pearce , the housekeeper . can i help you ?
oh , good morning , missus . i 'd like to see the professor , please .
could you tell me what it 's about ?
it 's business of a personal nature .
oh . one moment , please .
mr. higgins ?
what is it , mrs. pearce ?
there 's a young woman who wants to see you , sir .
a young woman ? what does she want ?
oh , she 's quite a common girl , sir . very common , indeed .
i should have sent her away , only i thought perhaps you wanted her to talk into your machine .
has she an interesting accent ?
simply ghastly , mr. higgins .
good . let 's have her in . show her in , mrs. pearce .
very well , sir . it 's for you to say .
you know , this is rather a bit of luck . i 'll show you how i make records .
we 'll set her talking and then i 'll take her down first in bell 's visible speech , and then in broad romaic , and then we 'll get her on the phonograph ... so you can turn her on whenever you want with the written transcript before you .
this is the young woman , sir .
good morning , my good man .
might i have the pleasure of a word with you face-to-face ?
oh , no , no , no .
this is the girl i jotted down last night . she 's no use . i 've got all the records i want of the lisson grove lingo .
i 'm not going to waste another cylinder on that . now be off with you . i don 't want you .
don 't be so saucy . you ain 't heard what i come for yet . did you tell him i come in a taxi ?
nonsense , girl . what do you think a gentleman like mr. higgins cares what you came in ?
oh , we are proud .
well , he ain 't above giving lessons . not him . i heard him say so .
well , i ain 't come here to ask for any compliment , and if my money 's not good enough , i can go elsewhere .
good enough for what ?
good enough for you .
now you know , don 't ya ? i 'm come to have lessons , i am .
and to pay for ' em too , make no mistake .
well . and , um , what do you expect me to say ?
well , if you was a gentleman , you might ask me to sit down , i think .
don 't i tell you i 'm bringing you business ?
uh , pickering , should we ask this baggage to sit down or should we just throw her out of the window ?
oh ! i won 't be called a baggage , not when i 've offered to pay like any lady .
what do you want , my girl ?
i-- i want to be a lady in a flower shop ... instead of standing at the corner of tottenham court road .
but they won 't take me unless i can talk more genteel .
he said he could teach me . well , here i am .
ready to pay him , not asking any favor . and he treats me as if i was dirt !
i know what lessons cost as well as you do , and i 'm ready to pay .
how much ?
now you 're talkin ' .
i thought you 'd come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit of what you chucked at me last night .
you 'd had a drop in , hadn 't you , eh ?
sit down !
oh , well , if you 're going to make a compliment of it--
sit down !
sit down , girl . do as you 're told .
ohh !
what 's your name ?
eliza doolittle .
won 't you sit down , miss , uh , doolittle ?
oh . i don 't mind if i do .
now , uh , how much do you propose to pay me for these lessons ?
oh , i know what 's right .
a lady friend of mine gets french lessons for eighteen pence an hour ... from a real french gentleman .
well , you wouldn 't have the face to ask me the same for teachin ' me my own language ... as you would for french , so i won 't give more than a shillin ' , take it or leave it .
you know , pickering , if you think of a shilling ... not as a simple shilling , but as a percentage of this girl 's income , it works out as fully equivalent of , uh ,
60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire .
by george , it 's enormous . it 's the biggest offer i ever had .
sixty pounds ! what are you talking about ? where would i get sixty pounds ?
i never offered you 60 pounds !
oh , hold your tongue .
but i ain 't got 60 pounds !
oh , don 't cry , you silly girl . sit down . nobody 's going to touch your money .
somebody 's going to touch you with a broomstick if you don 't stop sniveling .
sit down !
oh , anybody would think he was my father .
if i decide to teach you , i 'll be worse than two fathers to you .
oh , here .
what 's this for ?
to wipe your eyes .
to wipe any part of your face that feels moist .
and remember , that 's your handkerchief and that 's your sleeve , and don 't confuse the one with the other if you want to become a lady in a shop .
it 's no use to talk to her like that , mr. higgins . she doesn 't understand you .
here , give that handkerchief to me ! he give it to me , not to you .
higgins , i 'm interested .
what about your boast that you could pass her off as a duchess at the embassy ball , eh ?
i 'll say you 're the greatest teacher alive if you can make that good .
i 'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can 't do it .
i 'll even pay for the lessons .
oh , you 're real good . thank you , captain .
you know , it 's almost irresistible .
she 's so deliciously low , so horribly dirty .
i ain 't dirty ! i washed my face and hands before i come , i did .
i 'll take it . i 'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe .
ohh !
we 'll start today . now . this moment . take her away , mrs. pearce , and clean her .
sandpaper , if it won 't come off any other way . is it a good fire in the kitchen ?
yes , but i--
take all her clothes off and burn them , and ring up and order some new ones .
just wrap her in brown paper ' til they come .
you 're no gentleman , you 're not , to talk of such things .
i 'm a good girl , i am , and i know what the likes of you are , i do .
we want none of your slum prudery here , young woman .
you 've got to learn to behave like a duchess .
now take her away , mrs. pearce , and if she gives you any trouble , wallop her .
i 'll call the police , i will !
but i 've got no place to put her .
well , put her in the dustbin .
ohh !
come , higgins , be reasonable .
you must be reasonable , mr. higgins . really , you must .
you can 't walk over everybody like this .
i ? walk over everybody ?
my dear mrs. pearce , my dear pickering , i had no intention of walking over anybody .
i merely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl .
i didn 't express myself clearly ... because i didn 't wish to hurt her delicacy or yours .
but , sir , you , you can 't take a girl up like that ... as , as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach .
why not ?
why not ? but you don 't know anything about her .
what about her parents ? she may be married .
garn !
there , as the girl very properly says , " garn ! "
who 'd marry me ?
by george , eliza , the streets will be strewn with the bodies of men ... shooting themselves for your sake before i 've done with you .
here , i 'm going .
he 's off his chump , he is . i don 't want no balmies teaching me .
oh , mad , am i ? all right , mrs. pearce , don 't ring up and order those new clothes .
throw her out !
stop , mr. higgins . i won 't allow it .
go home to your parents , girl .
i ain 't got no parents .
there you are . she ain 't got no parents . what 's all the fuss about ? nobody wants her .
she 's no use to anybody but me , so take her upstairs !
but what 's to become of her ?
is she to be paid anything ? oh , do be sensible , sir .
what would she do with money ? she 'll have her food and her clothes . she 'll only drink if you give her money .
oh , you are a brute ! it 's a lie ! nobody ever saw the sign of liquor on me .
oh , sir , you are a gentleman . don 't let him speak to me like that .
does it occur to you , higgins , the girl has some feelings ?
oh , no , i don 't think so . no feelings we need worry about .
well , have you , eliza ?
i 've got my feelings , same as anyone else .
mr. higgins , i must know on what terms the girl is to be here .
what 's to become of her when you 've finished your teaching ? you must look ahead a little , sir .
what 's to become of her if we leave her in the gutter ? answer me that , mrs. pearce .
that 's her own business , not yours , mr. higgins .
well , when i 'm done with her we 'll throw her back in the gutter and then it 'll be her own business again .
so that 'll be all right , won 't it ?
you 've no feelin ' heart in you .
you don 't care for nothing but yourself .
here , i 've had enough of this . i 'm goin ' , i am . you ought to be ashamed of yourself , you ought .
have some chocolates , eliza .
how do i know what might be in ' em ? i bet a girl 's been drugged by the likes of you .
pledge of good faith .
i 'll take one half ... and you take the other .
you 'll have boxes of them , barrels of them every day .
you 'll live on them , eh ?
i wouldn 't have et it , only i 'm too ladylike to take it out of me mouth .
think of it , eliza . think of chocolates .
and taxis and gold and diamonds !
ohh !
i don 't want no gold and no diamonds . i 'm a good girl , i am .
higgins , i really must interfere . mrs. pearce is quite right .
if this girl 's going to put herself in your hands for six months for an experiment in teaching , she must understand thoroughly what she 's doing .
hmm . eliza .
you are to stay here for the next six months , learning how to speak beautifully .
like a lady in a florist shop .
if you 're good and do whatever you 're told , you shall sleep in a proper bedroom , have lots to eat , and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis .
but if you are naughty and idle , you shall sleep in the back kitchen amongst the black beetles ... and be walloped by mrs. pearce with a broomstick .
at the end of six months , you shall be taken to buckingham palace ... in a carriage , beautifully dressed .
if the king finds out that you are not a lady , the police will take you to the tower of london where your head will be cut off ... as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls .
but if you are not found out , you shall have a present ... of , uh , seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop .
if you refuse this offer , you will be the most ungrateful , wicked girl ... and the angels will weep for you .
now are you satisfied , pickering ?
i don 't understand what in the world you 're talking about .
well , could i put it more plainly or fairly , mrs. pearce ?
come with me , eliza .
that 's right , mrs. pearce . bundle her off to the bathroom .
you 're a great bully , you are ! i won 't stay here if i don 't like it . i won 't let nobody wallop me !
don 't answer back , girl .
if i 'd known what i was letting myself in for , i wouldn 't have come here .
i 've always been a good girl , i have , and i won 't be put upon !
in six months-- in three if she has a good ear and a quick tongue--
i 'll take her anywhere and i 'll pass her off as anything .
i 'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch .
i 've never had a bath in me life , not what you 'd call a proper one .
