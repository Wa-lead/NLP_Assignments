noting with interest the two recent visits to myanmar by the special envoy of the secretary-general and the cooperation extended by the government of myanmar in that regard ,
deeply regretting the failure of the government of myanmar to cooperate fully with the relevant united nations mechanisms , in particular the special rapporteur , who still has not been invited to myanmar , despite assurances by the government of myanmar in 1999 that it would seriously consider a visit ,
1 . expresses its appreciation to the special rapporteur of the commission on human rights on the situation of human rights in myanmar for his interim report , and calls upon the government of myanmar to implement fully the recommendations made by the special rapporteur ;

6 . urges the government of myanmar to cease , without delay , all activities aimed at preventing the free exercise of internationally recognized human rights , including freedom of association , assembly , movement and speech , and in particular to remove all restrictions on the freedom of movement of aung san suu kyi and other members of the national league for democracy and on their freedom to communicate with the outside world ;
