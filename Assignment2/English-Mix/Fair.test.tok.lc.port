like a ladi in a florist shop .
if you 're good and do whatev you 're told , you shall sleep in a proper bedroom , have lot to eat , and monei to bui chocol and take ride in taxi .
but if you ar naughti and idl , you shall sleep in the back kitchen amongst the black beetl ... and be wallop by mr. pearc with a broomstick .
at the end of six month , you shall be taken to buckingham palac ... in a carriag , beautifulli dress .
if the king find out that you ar not a ladi , the polic will take you to the tower of london where your head will be cut off ... as a warn to other presumptu flower girl .
but if you ar not found out , you shall have a present ... of , uh , seven and six to start life with as a ladi in a shop .
if you refus thi offer , you will be the most ungrat , wick girl ... and the angel will weep for you .
