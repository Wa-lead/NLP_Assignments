yo@@ u kno@@ w , p@@ ic@@ kering , if yo@@ u th@@ in@@ k of a sh@@ illing .@@ .@@ . not as a sim@@ ple sh@@ illing , but as a percentage of this girl 's income , it works out as fully equivalent of , u@@ h ,
60 or 70 po@@ unds from a milli@@ on@@ air@@ e .
by georg@@ e , it 's enormous . it 's the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est offer i ever had .
sixty po@@ unds ! what are yo@@ u tal@@ king about ? where would i ge@@ t sixty po@@ unds ?
i never offered yo@@ u 60 po@@ unds !
o@@ h , hold y@@ our t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
but i ain '@@ t go@@ t 60 po@@ unds !
o@@ h , d@@ on '@@ t c@@ ry , yo@@ u si@@ l@@ ly girl . si@@ t down . no@@ body 's going to tou@@ ch y@@ our money .

it 's no use to tal@@ k to her li@@ ke that , mr. hi@@ g@@ gin@@ s . she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t understand yo@@ u .
here , give that hand@@ k@@ er@@ chief to me ! he give it to me , not to yo@@ u .
hi@@ g@@ gin@@ s , i '@@ m interested .
what about y@@ our bo@@ ast that yo@@ u could p@@ ass her off as a du@@ ch@@ ess at the em@@ b@@ ass@@ y b@@ all , e@@ h ?

i '@@ ll be@@ t yo@@ u all the expenses of the experiment that yo@@ u can '@@ t do it .
i '@@ ll even pay for the lessons .
o@@ h , yo@@ u '@@ re real good . than@@ k yo@@ u , cap@@ tain .
yo@@ u kno@@ w , it 's al@@ most ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .

san@@ d@@ paper , if it w@@ on '@@ t come off any other way . is it a good fire in the kit@@ ch@@ en ?
y@@ es , but i-@@ -
take all her clo@@ th@@ es off and bur@@ n them , and ring up and order some new ones .
just w@@ ra@@ p her in bro@@ wn paper ' ti@@ l they come .
yo@@ u '@@ re no gen@@ tle@@ man , yo@@ u '@@ re not , to tal@@ k of such things .
i '@@ m a good girl , i am , and i kno@@ w what the lik@@ es of yo@@ u are , i do .
we w@@ ant none of y@@ our slum pr@@ u@@ der@@ y here , young w@@ oman .
yo@@ u '@@ ve go@@ t to learn to be@@ have li@@ ke a du@@ ch@@ ess .

m@@ y de@@ ar m@@ r@@ s@@ . pe@@ ar@@ ce , m@@ y de@@ ar p@@ ic@@ kering , i had no intention of w@@ al@@ king over an@@ y@@ body .
i me@@ rely sugges@@ ted we should be kind to this poor girl .
i di@@ d@@ n '@@ t express m@@ y@@ self clearly .@@ .@@ . because i di@@ d@@ n '@@ t wish to hur@@ t her de@@ lic@@ acy or y@@ ours .
but , si@@ r , yo@@ u , yo@@ u can '@@ t take a girl up li@@ ke that .@@ .@@ . as , as if yo@@ u were p@@ ic@@ king up a pe@@ b@@ ble on the be@@ ach .
wh@@ y not ?
wh@@ y not ? but yo@@ u d@@ on '@@ t kno@@ w an@@ y@@ thing about her .
what about her parents ? she may be marri@@ ed .
g@@ ar@@ n !

i ain '@@ t go@@ t no parents .
there yo@@ u are . she ain '@@ t go@@ t no parents . what 's all the f@@ us@@ s about ? no@@ body w@@ ants her .
she 's no use to an@@ y@@ body but me , so take her up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s !
but what 's to become of her ?
is she to be paid an@@ y@@ thing ? o@@ h , do be sen@@ sible , si@@ r .
what would she do with money ? she '@@ ll have her food and her clo@@ th@@ es . she '@@ ll only dr@@ in@@ k if yo@@ u give her money .
o@@ h , yo@@ u are a bru@@ te ! it 's a li@@ e ! no@@ body ever sa@@ w the sign of liqu@@ or on me .
o@@ h , si@@ r , yo@@ u are a gen@@ tle@@ man . d@@ on '@@ t le@@ t him spe@@ ak to me li@@ ke that .
does it occur to yo@@ u , hi@@ g@@ gin@@ s , the girl has some fe@@ el@@ ings ?

what 's to become of her if we leave her in the gu@@ tter ? an@@ sw@@ er me that , m@@ r@@ s@@ . pe@@ ar@@ ce .
that 's her own business , not y@@ ours , mr. hi@@ g@@ gin@@ s .
well , when i '@@ m done with her we '@@ ll thro@@ w her back in the gu@@ tter and then it '@@ ll be her own business again .
so that '@@ ll be all right , w@@ on '@@ t it ?
yo@@ u '@@ ve no fe@@ el@@ in ' heart in yo@@ u .

if this girl 's going to put her@@ self in y@@ our han@@ ds for six months for an experiment in teaching , she must understand thoroughly what she 's doing .
h@@ m@@ m . el@@ iz@@ a .
