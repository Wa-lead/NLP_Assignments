noting with interest the two recent visits to myanmar by the special envoy of the secretary-general and the cooperation extended by the government of myanmar in that regard ,

6 . urges the government of myanmar to cease , without delay , all activities aimed at preventing the free exercise of internationally recognized human rights , including freedom of association , assembly , movement and speech , and in particular to remove all restrictions on the freedom of movement of aung san suu kyi and other members of the national league for democracy and on their freedom to communicate with the outside world ;

the general assembly
adopts the following declaration :
united nations millennium declaration
i. values and principles
1 . we , heads of state and government , have gathered at united nations headquarters in new york from 6 to 8 september 2000 , at the dawn of a new millennium , to reaffirm our faith in the organization and its charter as indispensable foundations of a more peaceful , prosperous and just world .
2 . we recognize that , in addition to our separate responsibilities to our individual societies , we have a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity , equality and equity at the global level . as leaders we have a duty therefore to all the world 's people , especially the most vulnerable and , in particular , the children of the world , to whom the future belongs .
3 . we reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the charter of the united nations , which have proved timeless and universal . indeed , their relevance and capacity to inspire have increased , as nations and peoples have become increasingly interconnected and interdependent .
4 . we are determined to establish a just and lasting peace all over the world in accordance with the purposes and principles of the charter . we rededicate ourselves to support all efforts to uphold the sovereign equality of all states , respect for their territorial integrity and political independence , resolution of disputes by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law , the right to self-determination of peoples which remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation , non-interference in the internal affairs of states , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , respect for the equal rights of all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion and international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .
5 . we believe that the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world 's people . for while globalization offers great opportunities , at present its benefits are very unevenly shared , while its costs are unevenly distributed . we recognize that developing countries and countries with economies in transition face special difficulties in responding to this central challenge . thus , only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future , based upon our common humanity in all its diversity , can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable . these efforts must include policies and measures , at the global level , which correspond to the needs of developing countries and economies in transition and are formulated and implemented with their effective participation .
6 . we consider certain fundamental values to be essential to international relations in the twenty-first century . these include :
• freedom . men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity , free from hunger and from the fear of violence , oppression or injustice . democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best assures these rights .
• equality . no individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from development . the equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be assured .
• solidarity . global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice . those who suffer or who benefit least deserve help from those who benefit most .
• tolerance . human beings must respect one other , in all their diversity of belief , culture and language . differences within and between societies should be neither feared nor repressed , but cherished as a precious asset of humanity . a culture of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be actively promoted .
• respect for nature . prudence must be shown in the management of all living species and natural resources , in accordance with the precepts of sustainable development . only in this way can the immeasurable riches provided to us by nature be preserved and passed on to our descendants . the current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption must be changed in the interest of our future welfare and that of our descendants .
• shared responsibility . responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development , as well as threats to international peace and security , must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally . as the most universal and most representative organization in the world , the united nations must play the central role .
7 . in order to translate these shared values into actions , we have identified key objectives to which we assign special significance .
ii . peace , security and disarmament
8 . we will spare no effort to free our peoples from the scourge of war , whether within or between states , which has claimed more than 5 million lives in the past decade . we will also seek to eliminate the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction .
9 . we resolve therefore :
• to strengthen respect for the rule of law in international as in national affairs and , in particular , to ensure compliance by member states with the decisions of the international court of justice , in compliance with the charter of the united nations , in cases to which they are parties .
• to make the united nations more effective in maintaining peace and security by giving it the resources and tools it needs for conflict prevention , peaceful resolution of disputes , peacekeeping , post-conflict peace-building and reconstruction . in this context , we take note of the report of the panel on united nations peace operations , and request the general assembly to consider its recommendations expeditiously .
• to strengthen cooperation between the united nations and regional organizations , in accordance with the provisions of chapter viii of the charter .
• to ensure the implementation , by states parties , of treaties in areas such as arms control and disarmament and of international humanitarian law and human rights law , and call upon all states to consider signing and ratifying the rome statute of the international criminal court .
• to take concerted action against international terrorism , and to accede as soon as possible to all the relevant international conventions .
• to redouble our efforts to implement our commitment to counter the world drug problem .
• to intensify our efforts to fight transnational crime in all its dimensions , including trafficking as well as smuggling in human beings and money laundering .
• to minimize the adverse effects of united nations economic sanctions on innocent populations , to subject such sanctions regimes to regular reviews and to eliminate the adverse effects of sanctions on third parties .
• to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and to keep all options open for achieving this aim , including the possibility of convening an international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers .
• to take concerted action to end illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , especially by making arms transfers more transparent and supporting regional disarmament measures , taking account of all the recommendations of the forthcoming united nations conference on illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .
• to call on all states to consider acceding to the convention on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction , as well as the amended mines protocol to the convention on conventional weapons .
10 . we urge member states to observe the olympic truce , individually and collectively , now and in the future , and to support the international olympic committee in its efforts to promote peace and human understanding through sport and the olympic ideal .
iii . development and poverty eradication
11 . we will spare no effort to free our fellow men , women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty , to which more than a billion of them are currently subjected . we are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want .
12 . we resolve therefore to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty .
13 . success in meeting these objectives depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country . it also depends on good governance at the international level and on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems . we are committed to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system .
14 . we are concerned about the obstacles developing countries face in mobilizing the resources needed to finance their sustained development . we will therefore make every effort to ensure the success of the high-level international intergovernmental event on financing for development , to be held in 2001 .
15 . we also undertake to address the special needs of the least developed countries . in this context , we welcome the third united nations conference on the least developed countries to be held in may 2001 and will endeavour to ensure its success . we call on the industrialized countries :
• to adopt , preferably by the time of that conference , a policy of duty- and quota-free access for essentially all exports from the least developed countries ;
• to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction ; and
• to grant more generous development assistance , especially to countries that are genuinely making an effort to apply their resources to poverty reduction .

recognizing also that the problem of the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is often related to development problems and that those links and the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade require , within the context of shared responsibility , appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities , in the affected areas of those countries , that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,
stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem ,
ensuring that women and men benefit equally , and without any discrimination , from strategies directed against the world drug problem , through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making ,

annex ii
trust fund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf for developing states , in particular the least developed countries and small island developing states , and compliance with article 76 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea
terms of reference , guidelines and rules
1 . reasons for establishing the trust fund
1 . promoting and developing the marine scientific and technological capacity of developing states , in particular the least developed countries and small island states , with a view to accelerating their social and economic development , is essential for the effective implementation of the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 10 december 1982 ( " the convention " ) .
2 . coastal states intending to establish the outer limits of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of their territorial sea is measured are required by article 76 of the convention to submit the relevant data and information to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf ( " the commission " ) . in accordance with article 4 of annex ii to the convention , the particulars of such limits should be submitted to the commission within ten years of the entry into force of the convention for that state . for some states a submission should be made by 16 november 2004 .
3 . developing states , in particular the least developed countries and small island developing states , may face difficulties in complying with the time limit for submissions to the commission . the trust fund is intended to assist these states in complying with the requirements relating to a submission to the commission .
4 . under article 3 , paragraph 1 ( b ) , of annex ii to the convention , the commission may provide scientific and technical advice , if requested by the coastal states concerned , during the preparation of the data to be submitted in accordance with article 76 .
5 . the commission has adopted an outline for a five-day training course in order to facilitate the preparation of submissions in accordance with its scientific and technical guidelines . the course is to be developed and delivered by interested governments , international organizations and institutions which possess the necessary expertise and facilities . the commission has likewise prepared a basic flow chart illustrating the preparation of submissions by coastal states .
6 . the delineation of the continental shelf of a coastal state in accordance with article 76 and annex ii to the convention and annex ii to the final act of the third united nations conference on the law of the sea ( " the final act " ) requires a programme for hydrographic and geoscientific surveying and mapping of the continental margin . the complexity and scale , and hence the costs involved , of such a programme will vary greatly from state to state according to the different geographical and geophysical circumstances . a first approach will always involve an assessment of the particular case at hand , followed by planning of appropriate projects for further data acquisition . such projects require the contracting of high-level scientific / technical expertise and modern technology . by nature , the costs involved in such data acquisition projects are substantial . in addition to contributing to the voluntary fund herein established , the international community should make every effort to facilitate the full implementation of article 76 both financially and in any other possible way or capacity .
7 . the initial assessment and the project planning itself will require qualifications in hydrography and geosciences in addition to a full understanding of the relevant provisions of the convention . the final preparation of a submission to the commission also requires high-level expertise in geosciences and hydrography .
8 . the united nations has extensive experience in providing assistance to countries for their industrial and economic development . this experience could be extended and utilized to assist states in implementing their rights and obligations under article 76 of the convention .
2 . objects and purpose of the trust fund
9 . the secretary-general , under the financial regulations and rules of the united nations , establishes the present trust fund ( " the fund " ) . the object of the fund is to enable developing states , in particular the least developed coastal countries and small island developing states , to make an initial assessment of their particular case , make appropriate plans for further investigations and data acquisition , and to prepare the final submission documents when the necessary data have been acquired .
10 . the data acquisition campaigns themselves are not the object of the fund .
11 . an initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf of a coastal state is often made in the form of a desktop study , which is a review and compilation of all existing data and information . decisions for further action and / or planning for further data acquisition and mapping projects will be based on such a study .
12 . the purpose of the fund is to provide , in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the financial regulations and rules of the united nations :

deeply concerned that , despite continued efforts , racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in magnitude , incessantly adopting new forms , including tendencies to establish policies based on racial , religious , ethnic , cultural and national superiority or exclusivity ,
particularly alarmed at the increase in racist violence in many parts of the world , inter alia , as a result of resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters , as reflected in the report of the special rapporteur , and at the persisting use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies ,

noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ,

underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination , and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes , and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication ,
